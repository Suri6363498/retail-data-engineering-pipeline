### 🛒 Retail Data Engineering Pipeline Project

This is a **complete data engineering project** I built using free trial access to:

* **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** – for data ingestion and scheduling
* **Databricks (with PySpark)** – for cleaning and transforming the data
* **Tableau** – for creating an interactive dashboard

---

### ✅ Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world retail scenario where sales data is cleaned, transformed, and visualized.

**Goal:**
To help a retail business monitor category performance, region-wise sales, and time trends using a cloud-based automated pipeline.
